# My Portfolio

## About
I designed this portfolio with the 3d animated card in mind to seperate myself from most other portfolios. Instead of doing a static image with an ordinary navbar, I encorporated a fun 3d style design that has the navbar elements in it while also being mobile friendly. 

On mobile however, I do not have the 3d effect as you cant hover so keeping that effect while clicking on the card deminished the user experience.
